      Did you know you can use a Project Fi SIM on any GSM phone? I've heard whispers
      that you can also do it on CDMA networks that use SIMs, but I haven't tried that myself.
      
      I've tried using my main SIM in a Nextbit Robin and while it generally worked very, very well,
      it (obviously) doesn't work any different than a normal phone. Meaning, if I wasn't getting cell
      service, I wasn't getting anything.
      
      Enter the data-only SIM and Google Hangouts.
